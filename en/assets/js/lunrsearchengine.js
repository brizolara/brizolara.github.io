I'm currently researching links from human movement to sound systems (mainly bottom-up synthesis) and to visuals, either explicit or AI-driven (the Elemental comes from this research). I've been creating brazilian instrumental music (choro,  jazz , etc) and audio design/soundtrack/creative coding in works with other artists and performers for some years now - musicians, DJs, actors, dancers. . . I lived in Brazil until 2018, now I'm doing my PhD at Université Bretagne Sud, France.  I have also a long experience in software development in the medical software industry, with a master in Medical Physics (UFSC, Brazil).

Between 2005 and 2015 he presented compositions at festivals in SC, PR and SP, acted as a musician, lecturer and proponent in popular and folk music projects - with emphasis on artistic presentations in Santiago-Chile (2013) and Lima-Peru (2015) and two independent CDs. Since 2016 he has been working in music, sound art, development for visuals, extended dance and digital luthierie with R. I. S. C. O. and with interactive digital installations and soundtrack / sound design with Atelier Digital O Sítio, among other partners. In these areas, he was also a teacher of courses and workshops and a professor at Fatenp-SC. He is currently a PhD student in Computing and Human Movement at Université Bretagne Sud (France), researching interactive audiovisual computational applications for stage performance. He holds a master's degree in Physics from UFSC-SC, a specialist in Digital Game Development from PUC-PR, was a Music Composition student at UEM-PR and attended the courses Orchestration I and Music Composition for Film, TV and Games (Berklee School of Music Online ), as well as a consultant in software development for the medical field.

    "body": "2020/07/01 - Wind, rain and thunder, embodied as music/sound instruments. The Elemental is a new development in music expression, gathering recent advances in real-time digital audio design via synthesis (i. e. , without pre-recorded sounds) and new human-machine interfaces, to appropriate natural sounds in an axis of expression that traverses since sounds as found in nature up to the abstract experience, passing by what I call surreal performance: the sounds are real, but their behaviour, now dictated by the body of the performer, is new. In the video the multiartist Maria Flor, from recife City (Brazil), tests the instrument for the first time. I thank João Tragtenberg and the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), in the persons of professors Filipe Calegario and Giordano Cabral, for the partnership during the international mobility that I developed along with UFPE’s Center of Infomatics. The mobility was funded by the department of Morbihan and Bretagne region, in the context of my PhD at Université Bretagne Sud (France). A paper was published in NIME 2020 conference (click here to download):Tiago Brizolara, Sylvie Gibet, and Caroline Larboulette. 2020. Elemental: a Gesturally Controlled System to Perform Meteorological Sounds. Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, Birmingham City University, pp. 470–476. Abstract: In this paper, we present and evaluate Elemental, a NIME (New Interface for Musical Expression) based on audio synthesis of sounds of meteorological phenomena, namely rain, wind and thunder, intended for application in contemporary music/sound art, performing arts and entertainment. We first describe the system, controlled by the performer’s arms through Inertial Measuring Units and Electromyography sensors. The produced data is analyzed and used through mapping strategies as input of the sound synthesis engine. We conducted user studies to refine the sound synthesis engine, the choice of gestures and the mappings between them, and to finally evaluate this proof of concept. Indeed, the users approached the system with their own awareness ranging from the manipulation of abstract sound to the direct simulation of atmospheric phenomena - in the latter case, it could even be to revive memories or to create novel situations. This suggests that the approach of instrumentalization of sounds of known source may be a fruitful strategy for constructing expressive interactive sonic systems.
