Released in April 2020, this EP is composed of two milongas, a genre from _gaucho_ culture, from Río de la Plata region - Argentina and Uruguay - but largely performed in Brazil also. Both were born at a glance: I created Milonga para Minha Mãe (Milonga to my mother) music right when Iara Germer showed the poem which she wanted to turn into a milonga. And Iara created the lyrics of the Milonga do Quem Dera (the "I Wish" milonga, let's say) while listening to me, Flora Holderbaum (violin) and Gilnei Silveira (percussion) rehearsing to perform it instrumental on the next day!

Both me and Iara were born in southern Brazil, in a region with _gaucho_ culture, and decided to turn the songs into an EP, inviting the accordionist Bruno Moritz, with whom we recorded them in a very nice afternoon at Carlos Lacerda's studio in Florianópolis-SC-Brazil. 

I wrote Milonga do Quem Dera arrangement for the accordion, but the beautiful and idiomatic lines in Milonga para Minha Mãe are Bruno's improvisation.

The stunning cover photograph was taken by Núbia Abe, at Rios Salto's waterfall, in Águas Mornas-SC-Brazil.
