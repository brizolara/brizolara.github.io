Layers of watercolor are revealed as the visitors approach, tracing softly their silhouettes. Beyond the Limiar (*Threshold*) there live intelligent forms that seek the participants, but, that when they get too close, turn buck away. The soundtrack co-interact with some graphical elements, related to the presence and interaction of the visitors. The projection is in widescreen format and the audio has reactive spatialization.
