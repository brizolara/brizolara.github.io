<p>I'm a composer, developer and scientist. I'm currently researching links from human movement to sound systems (mainly bottom-up synthesis) and to visuals, either explicit or AI-driven (the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Elemental">Elemental</a> comes from this research). I've been creating brazilian instrumental music (choro, "jazz", etc) and audio design/soundtrack/creative coding in works with other artists and performers for some years now - musicians, DJs, actors, dancers... I lived in Brazil until 2018, now I'm doing my PhD at Université Bretagne Sud, France.  
<br>I have also a long experience in software development in the medical software industry, with a master in Medical Physics (UFSC, Brazil).<!--</br>-->
