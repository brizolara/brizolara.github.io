# Changes to Mediumish Jekyll theme, originally by wowthemesnet

This is a portfolio site, based on Mediumish, a Jekyll theme in format of blog similar to the famous *Medium* website.

Significant changes:
- Author info, date, ratings were all removed from the boxes (postbox.html and featuredbox.html)
- Instead, a set of small buttons reflecting the type of media found in the post are shown at the bottom (they are defined in small_buttons_postbox.html)
- Added internationalization via Jekyll plugin *polyglot*. It is also included as a git submodule, in case it needs to be recompiled (do this by `gem install jekyll-polyglot` inside \poliglot). For usage, please check poliglot's README.
