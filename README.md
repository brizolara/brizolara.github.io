# Tiago Brizolara's website

_It's also being redirected from http://tiagobrizolara.com._

This is my portfolio site, based on [Mediumish](#mediumish---jekyll-theme).

## Significant changes to Mediumish Jekyll theme:
- Author info, date, ratings were all removed from the boxes (postbox.html and featuredbox.html) and posts (post.html), except for author info, that's still in  the posts.
- Instead, a set of small buttons reflecting the type of media found in the post are shown at the bottom (they are defined in small_buttons_postbox.html) - see image.

- Added internationalization via Jekyll plugin *polyglot*. For usage, please check poliglot's README at https://github.com/untra/polyglot.

## Building site

For now, I **couldn't add polyglot correctly to GitHub Pages** (but you can try reading about [GH Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/pt/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) and [GH Pages and Jekyll plugins](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site). If you succeeded, make a pull request :wink:), so I'm building the site locally and commiting the builded page in the folder \_site. I created a git subtree that links this folder \_site to the branch gh-pages, from which the site is being deployed in GitHub Pages.

So, my current workflow is
- push your changes to the master branch
- `git subtree push --prefix _site origin gh-pages`
- (Just need to be done once) In your [repository settings](https://github.com/brizolara/brizolara.github.io/settings), set your GitHub Pages site to be buit from the **gh-pages** branch.

Voil√†. My site is up at https://brizolara.github.io/ (if you fork, you have to change the repository name in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brizolara/brizolara.github.io/settings)).
